1. Working with the following sets of integers `S= {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}`

- What is
  - [x] 4 + 4 = `1`
  - [x] 3 \* 5 = `1`
  - [x] What is the inverse of 3 = `2`

2. For `S={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}` Can we consider `S` and the operation `+` as a group? Why or why not? `Yes`

   ### ChatGPT-3 Response

   > In mathematics, a group is a set equipped with a binary operation that satisfies the following four axioms:

   > Closure: For all elements a and b in the set, their binary operation a + b is also an element in the set.

   > Associativity: For all elements a, b, and c in the set, the expression (a + b) + c is equal to a + (b + c).

   > Identity element: There exists an element e in the set such that for all elements a in the set, a + e = a.

   > Inverse element: For every element a in the set, there exists another element b in the set such that a + b = e.

   > Since the set S with the operation of addition + satisfies these four axioms, it can be considered a group. The identity element for this group is 0, since a + 0 = a for all elements a in the set. The inverse elements are also well-defined, since for each a in the set, a + (7-a) = 7 = 0 + 7 = e, where 7 is the least common multiple of the elements in S
