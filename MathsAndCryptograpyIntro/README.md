1. Working with the following sets of integers `S= {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}`

- What is
  - [x] 4 + 4 = `1`
  - [x] 3 \* 5 = `1`
  - [x] What is the inverse of 3 = `1`

2. For `S={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}` Can we consider `S` and the operation `+` as a group? Why or why not? `No`

3. What is -13 mod 5? `3`

4. Polynomials, For the polynomial `x^3^ - x^2^ + 4x - 12`, Find,

- [x] the positve roots? = `2, 3`
- [x] What is the degree of this polynomial? = `3`
